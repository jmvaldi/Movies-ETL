# Movies-ETL

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to collect movie data from the sites wikipedia and kaggle to create a database of movies that will eventually become popular. The company Amazing Prime Video will then be able to buy these movie rights at a bargain. The data was first extracted and then transformed to a clean database by using Python Panda library. The data was then loaded into PstgreSQL to see a query of the refined data tables created.
